# US Immigration Detention Centers
Data on all known United States Immigration Detention Centers

Goals: 
Create a database of US Immigration Detention Centers, including their location, known attributes, and costs.
Use database to create a map of these Centers, for direct political and activist use.

About:
While U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) makes their facility locations available online, certain attributes of them are not easily available. Inspired by and borrowing from databases created by CIVIC (www.endisolation.org) and the Global Detention Project (www.globaldetentionproject.org), this database will overlay detention facilities in active use by ICE with state, county, and congressional districts, in order to faciliate political pressure against local governments that allow the detention of undocumented immigrants within their county facilities.

Access the data as a Google Sheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ht8h-muW3DJXJv1T_C5UnXJNdUOcLLlDlxf6NP7bVhg/edit?usp=sharing
